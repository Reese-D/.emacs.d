* Emacs Configuration
Tested with emacs version 26.3 in Debian 9 (windows subshell) & 10

** Initialization
Just clone this file in your home directory (~)

Emacs automatically looks for a file on the path ~/.emacs.d/init.el on startup

The init file is also setup to load in any files from the custom_elisp folder as well as the custom.el file

Don't edit the custom.el file, it's automatically generated

** What's up with the zip file?
It's a backup, you can unzip it to make sure you have the same elpa directory used in testing, or you can just leave it alone/delete it

The elpa file should automatically regenerate

** .org files

These are used to manage the README (this file) and the init.el files

** Keybindings

All custom keybindings can be found in the init.el file. 

** init.el documentation

Since the init.el file is managed with org mode, i've created a markdown file to give simple documentation of the file.
