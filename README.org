#+TITLE: Emacs 
#+PROPERTY: tangle README.md

* Emacs Configuration
Tested with [[http://gnu.mirror.constant.com/emacs/emacs-26.3.tar.gz][emacs version 26.3]] in Debian 9 (windows subshell) & 10

** Initialization
Just clone this file in your home directory (~)

Emacs automatically looks for a file on the path ~/.emacs.d/init.el on startup

The init file is also setup to load in any files from the custom\under{}elisp folder as well as the custom.el file

Don't edit the custom.el file, it's automatically generated

** What's up with the zip file?
It's a backup, you can unzip it to make sure you have the same elpa directory used in testing, or you can just leave it alone/delete it

If you don't unzip the file, the elpa folder should automatically regenerate the first time you run emacs

** .org files
   
These are used to manage the README (this file) and the init.el files

** Keybindings

All custom keybindings can be found in the init.el file. 

** init.el documentation

Since the [[file:init.el][init.el]] file is managed with org mode, i've created a markdown file in the home directory [[file:init.md][init.md]] that includes some documentation
